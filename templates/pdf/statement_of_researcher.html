            This procedure, including the ifgi-EthicsWebApp is intended only as a guideline to research-active students and employees of WWU Institute for Geoinformatics.
            The responsibility for the wellbeing of research participants lies on the side of the researcher. Any uncertainties can be discussed with the ifgi-Ethics Committee.
            Research approval is granted conditional to the following provisions:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">1. Before the study begins, you are obliged to present the Participant with an Informed Consent Form (a template is automatically generated based on the data provided by you in the previous steps);</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">2. You are obliged to collect a signed copy and keep it for reference as well as to provide the participant with a signed copy of the Informed Consent Form.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">3. You are obliged to allow the participant to quit the study at any point with no further consequences. If applicable, payment is still due if the participant decides to withdraw his or her data at the end of the study (i.e. during the de-briefing phase).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">4. You are obliged to follow the Institute procedure with regard to the handling of sensitive private data.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">5. If the study involves collection of information without obtaining prior consent from some participants (e.g. public observation of human behaviour) information allowing the researcher to potentially identify or harm the person cannot be collected (e.g. many big data studies, street surveys). <b>Observations and recordings of public behaviour without consent can only occur if people can be reasonably expected to be observed by strangers at the given place and time</b> (with respect to the local cultural norms).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">6. People have the right to know who is observing them in non-public situations (such as a meeting room, a laboratory). This right must be respected.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">7. If your study involves your own students, declining participation cannot be linked (formally or informally) to the course grading scheme. If participation in the study is rewarded with credit points, alternative means of obtaining the same number of points at the comparable time expense and effort must be made available.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">8. I confirm I will provide de-briefing information based on the below form either verbally or in written form to all participants of the study.</p>
